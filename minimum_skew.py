Let's follow the 5' â†’ 3' direction of DNA and walk along the chromosome from terC to oriC (along a reverse half-strand), then continue on from oriC to terC (along a forward half-strand). In our previous discussion, we saw that the skew is decreasing along the reverse half-strand and increasing along the forward half-strand. Thus, the skew should achieve a minimum at the position where the reverse half-strand ends and the forward half-strand begins, which is exactly the location of oriC!

We have just developed an insight for a new algorithm for locating oriC: it should be found where the skew attains a minimum.

Minimum Skew Problem: Find a position in a genome minimizing the skew.
     Input: A DNA string Genome.
     Output: All integer(s) i minimizing Skewi (Genome) among all values of i (from 0 to |Genome|).
