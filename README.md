Solutions to problems for the Coursera Bioinformatics Class

## Instructions
You will need my custom [stringutil](https://github.com/tmpjr/stringutil) package to use some of the scripts in this repository. Simply get it using the standard 'go get' tool before building/running any of the scripts:
> go get github.com/tmpjr/stringutil

To run most scripts you will be required to provide an input file. Eg:
> go run reverse_complement.go < reverse_complement.txt
